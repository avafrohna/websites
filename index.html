                                <li>For his contributions to the development of quantum electrodynamics, Feynman received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1965 jointly with Julian Schwinger and Shin'ichir≈ç Tomonaga.</li>

                    <dd class="extra-description">
                        The Feynman Lectures on Physics is perhaps the most popular physics book ever written.The textbook comprises three volumes. The first volume focuses on mechanics, radiation, and heat, including relativistic effects. The second volume covers mainly electromagnetism and matter. The third volume covers quantum mechanics; for example, it shows how the double-slit experiment demonstrates the essential features of quantum mechanics. The book also includes chapters on the relationship between mathematics and physics, and the relationship of physics to other sciences.<br><br>

Part of the Focus on the Family Great Stories collection, this abridged edition features an in-depth introduction and discussion questions by Joe Wheeler to provide greater understanding for today's reader.

                    <dd class="extra-description">
                        Since its immediate success in 1813, Pride and Prejudice has remained one of the most popular novels in the English language. Jane Austen called this brilliant work "her own darling child" and its vivacious heroine, Elizabeth Bennet, "as delightful a creature as ever appeared in print." The romantic clash between the opinionated Elizabeth and her proud beau, Mr. Darcy, is a splendid performance of civilized sparring. And Jane Austen's radiant wit sparkles as her characters dance a delicate quadrille of flirtation and intrigue, making this book the most superb comedy of manners of Regency England.<br><br>

            <p>We tested our code on Safari and Chrome. When we viewed our finished website, there weren‚Äôt any differences, but while we were in the process of making it, we could spot more of our mistakes with the grid positioning on Chrome.</p>
            <p>As for printing, Safari had a lot more colour than Chrome, where the beige colour of the text was close to black. It also cut the table and images somewhere in the middle when going over to the next page, while Chrome usually stopped at the end of a table row and didn‚Äôt cut images in half. To try and fix this, we added ‚Äúpage-break-inside: avoid ‚Äú to these elements, but it seems as if Safari is ignoring it.</p>
